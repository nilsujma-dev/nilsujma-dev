### üëã Hi & Welcome @ my landing for nilsujma.io >>> I‚Äôm @nilsujma-dev

#### üåê About Me:
- **Global Citizen & Cultural Explorer:** Born and raised in a small town in Germany (Ohrdruf, Landkreis Gotha), my professional life has taken me across the the globe. During the last 7 years I am focussing on Asia-Pacific Region. My journey which started in South Korea, took me then to the Philippines and now to Singapore. This cultural journey, enriched by my Thai wife, shapes my global approach to cybersecurity challenges.
- **Career Journey & Global Influence:** Starting as an individual contributor, I now play an important role in regional and global cybersecurity, with my base in Singapore. My perspective, drawn from diverse living experiences, drives my work. In my current role as a Cloud Security Lead @ Check Point Software Technologies, I am coordinating pre-sales activities in & for a team of 15 cloud security specialists.
- I am certainly a Technologist and enjoy building sophisticated cloud security solutions for the Asia-Pacific region but also globally. 
- **Professional Mission:** Committed to safeguarding the digital realm, my ultimate goal is to make our world a little bit more safe from a Cyber Security Perspective. 
- **Expertise in Evolution:** With over 2 Decades in cybersecurity, my experience ranges from securing legacy systems to pioneering in cloud-native architectures. My passion lies in solving complex security challenges and guiding clients, partners, and teams through the evolving landscape of digital security. 

#### üéôÔ∏è Tech & Learnings Beyond the Cyber World:
- **Ham Radio Enthusiast:** I'm an avid Ham Radio operator with call signs 9V1AB (Singapore) and DL1MNU (Germany). I love operating on HF using digital modes such as FT8 but also do enjoy regular catch up's with friends by leveraging on "Brandmeister".
- Some time back I have **build and established DB0LM** in Limburg, Germany including operationalzing the DMR network in the region.
- **In Singapore** my focus is predominately on shortwave communication (HF) by leveraging Digital modes, as mentioned FT8. 
- **Endless Learner:** I am also fascinated by Quantum Physics and currently learning Thai. For the last I just completed 100 Hours of Lessons with my private Tutor. 

#### üå± Currently Coding in Python
- **Focusing on developing solutions, predominately for my work** - in Python
- **Coding was long time on the list of things I ever wanted to do**  but usually (as always in life) many reasons why I could not complete it yet.
- **Rise of DevOps and Automation** has changed a lot, which translates into direct professional impact with my growing coding skills.
- **First coding skills** at the age of 10 by using KC/85 computers and doing coding in simple Basic. After that I've learned Java as part of my professional education.
- **Shifting into Cyber Security** at that time at the age of 20, Coding wasn't required for a long time; so I started some time back to re-introduce it to myself by getting deeper into Python.
- **Finally Python - but still WIP** So don't worry when you see issues in my code or something which requires to be improved. 

#### üè† Personal Life
- I am married to my Thai wife and have 1 son from a previous marriage. I do enjoy travelling, good food, and I am a passionate Buddhist.
- Meditating üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and doing Merit üôè is an important part of my life and helps me to clear my mind from the hectical times in which we are in. Becoming a Budhist was certainly an important part of my life. My favorite temple is ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏ú‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏û‡∏¢‡πå‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ó‡∏ò‡∏¥‡πå‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏° https://t.ly/kVNIE
