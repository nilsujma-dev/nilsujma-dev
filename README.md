### 👋 Hi, I’m @nilsujma-dev

#### 🌐 About Me:
- **Global Citizen & Cultural Explorer:** Born and raised in a small town in Germany (Ohrdruf, Landkreis Gotha), my professional life has taken me across the the globe. During the last 7 years I am focussing on Asia-Pacific Region. My journey which started in South Korea, took me then to the Philippines and now to Singapore. This cultural journey, enriched by my Thai wife, shapes my global approach to cybersecurity challenges.
- **Career Journey & Global Influence:** Starting as an individual contributor, I now play an important role in regional and global cybersecurity, with my base in Singapore. My perspective, drawn from diverse living experiences, drives my work. In my current role as a Cloud Security Architecture Leader @ Check Point Software Technologies, I am coordinating pre-sales activities in & for a team of 15 cloud security specialists. I am a Technology lover and always work on building sophisticated cloud security solutions for the Asia-Pacific region and globally. 
- **Professional Mission:** Committed to safeguarding the digital realm, my ultimate goal is to make our world a little bit more safe from a Cyber Security Perspective. 
- **Expertise in Evolution:** With over 2 Decades in cybersecurity, my experience ranges from securing legacy systems to pioneering in cloud-native architectures. My passion lies in solving complex security challenges and guiding clients, partners, and teams through the evolving landscape of digital security. 

#### 🎙️ Beyond the Cyber World:
- **Ham Radio Enthusiast:** I'm an avid Ham Radio operator with call signs 9V1AB (Singapore) and DL1MNU (Germany). I love operating on HF using digital modes such as FT8 but also do enjoy regular catch up's with friends by leveraging on "Brandmeister".
- **Endless Learner:** Fascinated by Quantum Physics and currently learning Thai, my curiosity knows almost no bounds. I am exploring various fields, from the mysteries of the universe to the nuances of human languages.
